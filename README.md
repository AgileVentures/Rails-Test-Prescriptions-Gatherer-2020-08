# README

This is the "Gatherer" Rails application for the book **"Rails 5 Test Prescriptions: building a better codebase," by Noel Rappin.**
The Agile Ventures book group is working through the book together starting in August, 2020.

Some gems in this project are later versions than the ones specified in the book. 
Most importantly, the book uses for Rails 5.2, but this repository uses **Rails 6.0.3.2.**


### A Branch for Start of Each Chapter

There is a git branch for the _start_ each chapter. The branch has the code you should have at the start of the chapter.
You can start with the code in the branch and then work through the chapter.

Each branch follows the naming convention "chapter-_nn_-start", where _'nn'_ is the chapter number.

The first chapter that expects you to have code already written is _"Chapter 3: Test-Driven Rails,"_ so **the first branch with code is `chapter-03-start`.**


### Requirements

- Rails 6.0.3.2

- Ruby version 2.7.1

- SQLite3

- RSpec gems (rspec and rspec-rails) version 3.9
